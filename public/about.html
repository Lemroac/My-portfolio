<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Carmelo, I'm 29 yo and looking to became a Junior developer and I think it would be possible 
  thanks to Angela Yu's special course.</p>

<p>I want to became a full stack developer because I really love the tech industry since I was really
  young. 3 years ago I graduate to IT Specialist, thanks to a course in my city, where I take 97/100
  as final score.
</p>

<p>I'll always do my everything to be better in what I love. After this course I'll surely start
  a course to became an ethical hacker.
